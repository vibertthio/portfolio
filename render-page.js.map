Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.

Based on the idea of Patatap, “Beact” uses Two.js, Tone.js as audio and visual engine library respectively. It combines the concept of sequencer with keyboard, becoming a complete set for musician to perform their work in a browser. This project merges creative coding into the software architecture with conceptual integrity.</p>\\n<br>\\n<h2 id=\\\"inspiration\\\"><a href=\\\"#inspiration\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Inspiration</h2>\\n<p>In my spare time, I followed some artists/hackers/musicians who utilize the browser and internet as media to create. Sometimes, I found works so astonishing that I couldn’t close mouth in front of my computer. The concept “Patatap” is really fascinating, that each letter corresponds to a sound and an animation. It transforms abstract words into a beautiful outcome.</p>\\n<p>After a while, I wanted to use it as an instrument for my performance and compose songs out of it.

It consists of customized-size grid which contain directional information in each block. It connects to the whichever digital audio workstation (DAW) you are using through the software midi interface, synchronized by the clock sent from it. Player can adjust several parameters in each block, including beat number, note pitch, velocity, note duration and etc. The most important, you can rotate the direction in every block to generate a unique sequence of notes manually, or let the computer randomly create one for you.\\nIt’s currently prototyped in Processing.

The patients not only have to keep up to the tempo of the game, but also are able to compose their own melodies using the application (music game) created by the digital artists. The application interacts with Kinect technology and engages in the process of rehabilitation. It detects the gesture of the player.

First, the program guesses what value of a specific gate is. Secondly, it uses the analysis of time in “Implication” and verify the guessing. It always starts with the primary inputs, and deduce the status of whole circuit. If any conflict is encountered, it will backtrack the procedure and try different inputs until all possible input vectors are tried. The path is true if more than one input vector is found to justify it. Otherwise, it’s a false path.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"result\\\"><a href=\\\"#result\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Result</h2>\\n<p>Our program was capable of finding the true paths in cases with under 500 gates within seconds.
